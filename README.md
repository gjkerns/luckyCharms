# Lucky Charms

A team of YSU STAT 3743 students helped design and carry out an experiment to determine whether bowls of Lucky Charms are equally "lucky" over the course of a box of cereal. We estimate a decrease of approximately 2.7 total charms per additional bowl on average. This corresponds to more than a 50% drop-off in charms from the first bowl to the last. The weight of cereal also appears to play a role, and for each 1g of cereal we estimate approximately 0.5 more charms on average with bowl held constant. The interaction between bowl and weight is not statistically significant.

This repository contains all the original data and code used for analysis and for making interactive visualizations.  The experiment has been repeated since the original run and subsequent datasets are housed in `extraData`.
