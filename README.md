# Lucky Charms experiment

A team of YSU STAT 3743 students helped design and carry out an experiment to determine whether bowls of Lucky Charms are equally "lucky" over the course of a box of cereal. 

This repository houses all the original data and code used for analysis and for making interactive visualizations.  Data from later runs of the experiment are in `extraData`.
